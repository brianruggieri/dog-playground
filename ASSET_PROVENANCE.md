# Asset Provenance

## Ownership and origin

- All visual assets in `public/` were generated by Brian Ruggieri using AI image generation tools.
- No third-party stock packs, scraped game assets, or licensed marketplace packs are included.
- Current rendered formats:
	- Primary runtime: `.webp`
	- Backup compatibility format: `.png`

## Licensing split

- Code is licensed under MIT: `LICENSE`.
- Visual assets are explicitly licensed under CC BY 4.0: `LICENSE-ASSETS`.
- Asset license scope:
	- `public/backgrounds/*.{webp,png}`
	- `public/dogs/*.{webp,png}`
	- `public/toys/*.{webp,png}`

## Auditable manifest

- Per-file provenance metadata is tracked in `ASSET_MANIFEST.json`.
- The manifest includes:
	- path
	- SHA-256 hash
	- pixel dimensions
	- format
	- role (`background`, `dog`, `toy`)
	- source attribution metadata
	- backup linkage (`backup_of`) for PNG compatibility files
- Automation:
	- Generate/update manifest: `npm run assets:manifest`
	- Enforce compliance locally/CI: `npm run assets:check`

## AI disclosure and safety guardrails

- These images are AI-generated and should be disclosed as such where required.
- Do not add assets that intentionally imitate specific living artists, copyrighted characters, or trademarked brands without permission.
